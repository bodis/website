This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the Jekyll blog functionality.

## Getting Started

This blog is powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages. You can write posts in Markdown and they'll automatically be converted to HTML.

### How to Create a New Post

1. Create a new file in `_posts/` directory
2. Name it: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. Add front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000
categories: category1 category2
---
```

4. Write your content in Markdown below the front matter

### Example Content

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- [Links](https://github.com)

```python
# Code blocks with syntax highlighting
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

> Blockquotes for important notes

And much more!
